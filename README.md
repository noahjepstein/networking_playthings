This repo contains a bunch of networking toy projects written in C.

These were done as homework assignments for a networking course I took at Tufts University with Fahad Dogar.

All were required to have source named aX.c, and for all code to be in a single file. Which is lame. I know.

All were done quickly and hackily. A la homework under deadline.

Includes:
- Simple HTTP server
- Chat server and client
- UDP file transfer server
